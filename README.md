# Samuel Kuczynski Surfs Up

## Overview of Project

### The purpose of this analysis was to provide our partner with the data and tools needed to present to investors on our future Surfboard and Ice Cream shop in Hawaii. We used SQL Alchemy, Pandas,  and SQL Lite through VS Code to query through numerous different data points from the island we are targeting to open up on. We are also able present this information via a web browser for investors to look through and gather the data on their own screens.


## Results

### * Throughout this analysis we found that the weather is going to be ideal in the location we selected and have actually located a few other stations/areas where we could expand.
### * The differences between the weather in June + December are only a few degrees; this will allow us to provide amazing ice cream to the locals throughout the year and shouldnt see too much of a dropoff in temperature! 
### * Due to the temperature being still relatively close to June, we could also see tourists come through this area and could see an increase in sales due to this increased demand

## Summary

### Overall we found that our areas we selected are ideal for a new surfshop! The precipitation levels are not too high; and we will have a good amount of sunshine that will bring a ton of people for amazing waves. I think some further queries we will want to start gathering will be the total amount of customers we can forecast ourselves to see in a given year and start croudsourcing some information on favorite flavors from what the locals prefer + what the local trends are from the vacationers home country.
